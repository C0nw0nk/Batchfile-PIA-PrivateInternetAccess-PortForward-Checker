# About

Its a simple cmd script.

I designed and built it to be portable so you can move it from machine to machine in automated fashion on flash drives or what ever you require it will setup and connect the rest.

Fast simple and multiple uses.

If you use Linux and want to use this ofcourse you can use Wine or Mono with this.

If you have a office or network of hundreds of computers this can be put on them all. Protecting your entire network :)
